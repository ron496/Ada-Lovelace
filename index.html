          <ul>
            <li><strong>1815</strong> - December 10 London, United Kingdom</li>
            <li>
              <strong>review</strong> - Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, 
            registered at birth as Augusta Ada Byron and commonly known as Ada Lovelace, 
            was a British mathematician, computer scientist and writer,
            best known for her work on Charles Babbage's general-purpose calculator,
            the so-called analytical engine
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1815</strong> - She was born on Sunday, December 10, 1815.
             The girl is named after Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was named "Ada" by Byron himself. On January 5 of the following year, due to disagreements with her husband, her mother left home, 
             taking her with her while Byron slept. Annabella moved in with Ada in a house her parents owned in Seaham Durham
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1816</strong> - On January 16, 1816, on Lord Byron's order, Lady Byron went to her parents' home in Kirkby Mallory,
               taking her five-week-old daughter with her. Although English law at the time granted full custody of the children to the father in separation cases, Lord Byron did not attempt to claim his parental rights, but requested that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1816</strong> - On April 25, 1816, his father left England fleeing from his creditors and the scandal that hung over him over rumors of incest. Months later, Annabella filed a lawsuit for separation.
               During the eight years that Lord Byron was away from his country until his death he wrote frequently to Augusta and inquired about their daughter.
               Lovelace was not shown her father's family portrait until she was 20 years old.      
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1826</strong> - In June 1826, Ada, then ten years old, traveled outside England for the first time. She left with a whole group (including her mother) and the trip lasted 15 months, 
              during which Ada enjoyed everything new that her eyes saw, everything she heard, discovered, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1827</strong> - In the autumn of 1827 their trip ended and they settled directly in Bifrons, 
               a country mansion far from the city. Nothing of Ada's interest was going on in that palace; Furthermore, her mother was frequently away from home, so the girl devoted herself to studying and letting her imagination run wild. That same year Ada began her training in mathematics. At eleven years old, she was obsessed with the idea of ​​flying;
               she was determined to invent a machine that would allow her to move through the air
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1828</strong> - In February 1828, it was building wings.
               He investigated different materials and sizes. He considered various materials for the wings: 
               paper, oil silk, wire, and feathers. He spent years studying the anatomy of birds to determine the correct wing-to-body ratio, and creating sketches of his dream project. He decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of his findings. He decided what equipment he would need; for example, a compass, to "cross the country by the most direct path", so that it can overcome mountains,
               rivers and valleys. His last step was to integrate steam with the "art of flying".
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1829-1832</strong> - In early 1829 she contracted a serious illness, possibly measles,
               which caused paralysis of her legs and forced her to stay in bed until mid-1832.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1834</strong> - In 1834 Ada was closely related to William King, who had been commissioned by Lady Byron to guide her daughter morally; He also took it upon himself to teach him mathematics. It was during those classes that Ada realized that her passion was mathematics. He had already found the discipline to apply his extraordinary intelligence to. The summer of that year Ada and her mother toured the north of England, the most important industrial area, visiting many factories, where they could see the Jacquard loom in operation. During this time, mother and daughter were closely related to Mary Somerville, the most famous mathematician in her country. Other acquaintances included scientists Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, 
              Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and author Charles Dickens.
              Ada was already a regular at the Victorian Court and began to attend various events in which she frequently participated in the dances and dazzled many of her assistants, who described her as a charming being. However, John Hobhouse, who had been a friend of her father, was an exception, describing her as "a drawn and gaunt young woman but with some trait of her friend, especially her mouth." The description was made after their meeting on February 24, 1834, in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, 
              but this first impression did not last long and they later became friends.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1835</strong> - In the spring of 1835 Ada met William, Lord King. The aristocrat was from a very 
              influential family from a political, social, intellectual and religious point of view. 
              He owned several important estates and the title of lord was over a century old, so Lady Byron approved of their relationship. On July 8, 1835 they married, becoming Lady King. His residence became a large estate in Ockham Park (Ockham, Surrey), along with another in Torridon Fjord and one more in London. He spent his honeymoon at the Worthy Mansion, located in Asley Combe, Somerset, which had been built in 1799 as a hunting lodge and which King himself expanded on the occasion of his honeymoon.
              Later the house would become his summer retreat after being expanded again.
              The couple had three children: Byron, the heir, born on May 12, 1836; 
              Anne Isabella (called Annabella, later Lady Anne Blunt), 
              born on September 22, 1837; and Ralph Gordon, born July 2, 1839.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1841</strong> - In 1841, Ada wrote a letter to Babbage making it clear that she was interested in collaborating with him. Babbage liked the idea, so she began translating the article by the Italian scientist, Luigi Federico Menabrea. With the translation of the text, she had two objectives: to make her friend's valuable work known and to fulfill her dream of achieving an intellectual life that would elevate her above the demands of motherhood and marriage. Finally he called his work Notes, which consisted of his own study on the analytical machine, and as an annex, the translation of the article from Italian. Babbage advised her,  
                but Ada was the entire author of that work.
                Ada dedicates much of her study to describing in highly technical language how the analytical machine would work, but she also offers a series of observations that make her theoretical contribution clear. She clearly distinguished between data and processing; this thinking was revolutionary in its time. Ada aspired to create computer science, which she called the science of operations. He realized the practical 
                applications of the analytical engine and even glimpsed the possibility of digitizing music. He wrote in the Notes:
                "Suppose, for example, that the fundamental relationships between sounds, in the art of harmony, were susceptible to such expressions and adaptations: 
                the machine could compose musical pieces as long and complex as it wanted.
                Ada had a clear idea: the analytical machine and the Jacquard loom come to do the same. A key phrase where this is expressed is:
                "It can be said that the former weaves algebraic patterns, in the same way that the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves."
                Ada clearly expresses the three functions that Babbage's invention could accomplish: 
                processing mathematical formulas expressed with symbols, doing numerical calculations (her primary goal), and giving algebraic results in literal notation.
                Babbage and Ada conceived of the analytical engine very differently.
                The first was not much interested in its practical consequences. Ada, on the other hand, was obsessed with the applications of the invention. She was the first to intuit what Babbage's invention meant for technological progress. He understood that the technology used in the Jacquard loom and in the analytical machine could be applied to any process that involved
                processing data: in this way he opened the way to a new science, that of information computing.</li>
